This GitHub folder contains the source files for reproducing the main results in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06614.

1. **Notebooks** `.ipynb`:
    * `mnist_cmi_heatmap.ipynb`: calculates the conditional mutual information of the distribution of $60,000$ MNIST images with size $28 \times 28$.
    * `mnist_global_train.ipynb`: trains the global denoisers for MNIST, using U-Nets neural networks.
    * `mnist_local_train.ipynb`: trains the local denoisers for MNIST, using modified U-Nets neural networks. This notebook also tests all the quantitative and qualitative performance of using local denoisers to recover the original MNIST images.
    * `mnist_local_global_gen.ipynb`: shows the performance for local denoisers ($r = 3$), within different time intervals during the denoising process.

2. **Modules** `.py`: Auxiliary codes used in the calculations of global and local denoisers.

3. **Folders starting with** `results`: The stored results generated by the notebooks.

4. **Folders** `model-gen`: Models and Parameters of global and local denoisers generated by the notebooks.
